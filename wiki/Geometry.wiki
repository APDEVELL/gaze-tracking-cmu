#summary Head pose geometry

= Introduction =

In the Kinect x is horizontal, y is vertical and z is depth (an optical frame of reference).

Here we outline our approach to estimating gaze-direction labels by interpolating participant locations from our depth data, classifying their vertical tilt, then transforming to their horizontal (x-z) coordinate system to calculate their cone of attention.
