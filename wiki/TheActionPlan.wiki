= Details =

*Visualize calculated gaze direction (big arrow!)
*Correct segmentation bug between 2D box and 3D point cloud
*Create 3D model of room
*Create program to assign gaze to best object-of-gaze estimate
*Match outputs of above program to human-labeled data
*Interpolate higher order features around labeled robot deictic gesture events
*Perhaps add new data to overall analysis set as automating the video-coding is much faster than human-labeling the data
